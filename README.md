# gender-classification using Sci-kit Learn
In this project I have data regarding a person's height, weight, and shoe size. I've made a classifier which predicts the gender of a new person, using this data. The classification have been done using multiple classifiers.
I've used four classifiers provided by Sci-kit Learn:
1) Decision Tree 
2) Random Forest
3) Logistic Regression
4) Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
